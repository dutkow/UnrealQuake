As an educational project I am attempting to port some of Quake III Arena's code into the Unreal Engine in the form of a plugin. 

Th original source code is available at id-Software's GitHub: https://github.com/id-Software/Quake-III-Arena

I may not get very far, but my first goal is to port over at least the walking and aerial portions of the movement code to something that is usable on a Pawn in the Unreal Engine.
